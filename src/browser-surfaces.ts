// The browser half's server side: everything pi2dsh puts on DSH's web surface.
//
// Pi packages that open a side conversation (pi-btw's `/btw`, and anything
// else built on `createAgentSession`) get a real DSH child session — visible in
// the host's own subagent catalog, resumable, continuable. What DSH has no seat
// for is the SHAPE those packages present in Pi: a focused panel floating over
// the main conversation, so the side thread is readable without leaving the
// thread you were in.
//
// DSH's browser half does have a seat for exactly that (`shell.overlay`), so
// the panel is drawn by this package's own client half. Its data does NOT ride
// DSH's typed Remote system — that is a first-party, code-generated contract —
// but this package's own route, which is the honest way for an out-of-tree
// plugin to talk to its own UI.
//
// Two kinds of state live here, both keyed by the session they belong to:
//
//   threads   — side conversations a Pi package opened (the floating panel)
//   surfaces  — Pi's presentation calls (status, widget, header, footer, title,
//               working/thinking chrome). Pi hands these a string or one of its
//               own components; a component renders to plain text lines through
//               the bridge's headless pi-tui shims, which is what a browser can
//               actually show.
//
// Nothing here knows about any particular package. A thread is tracked because
// a Pi package opened a child session; a surface is recorded because a package
// called a Pi UI method — whatever the package.
