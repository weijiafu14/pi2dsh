 *
 * The Pi subagent bridge already serves the children IT mints: the creator's
 * per-spawn loader mount (a8b7a0a) runs at creation and again on a persisted
 * resume. This covers the OTHER lineage — children a DSH surface mints
 * directly (DSH-native delegation, headless subagents, a second agent in the
 * web UI) — which carry no Pi lineage and would otherwise run as plain DSH
 * agents with none of the profile's Pi extensions.
 *
 * One lineage check per created Agent (maintainer point 2): subagent origin
 * AND a session id that does not carry the bridge prefix. The bridge mints
 * `pi2dsh-sub-` ids at creation and a persisted resume keeps the original id,
 * so the skip holds on both bridge paths and a bridge child is never mounted
 * twice.
 *
 * The mount reuses the engine's own child-extension catalog (maintainer
 * point 3) — the same object the bridge's hook consumes — so a native child's
 * tool set is exactly Pi's default-discovered set (the catalog's no-loader
 * path), the mount lands on the child's OWN ctx and unwinds with the child,
 * and there is no second registration path to drift out of sync.
 *
 * Partition with the root-mount path: agents the registry reports as runtime
 * roots are installAgentScopedMounts' territory (it gates them the same way
 * this path does). Live delegation shows a DSH-native child of a top-level
 * session CAN be a runtime root — serving it here as well raced two mount
 * passes onto the same scope (each package survived via the prompt-section
 * guard, but the double attempt is exactly what this flag must not do). This
 * listener therefore serves exactly the remainder: subagent-origin,
 * non-bridge, non-root agents. The predicate is the root path's own, applied
 * at the same event; its fail-open (roots() unavailable ⇒ every agent is a
 * root) mirrors here as fail-closed (this listener serves nothing).
 *
 * The readiness promise is memoized on the child's SCOPE (agent.ctx), not the
 * agent object: a re-announced agent for the same session reuses the scope,
 * and the dedupe must key on what the mount actually lands in.
 *
 * First-turn gates mirror the root path's exactly: the child's first prompt
 * assembly and its direct tool executions await the mount, and the
 * pre-waterfall tools snapshot is reconciled against the official scoped
 * projection. Without the gate a mount that lands after the first turn's
 * snapshot leaves the child's first (and sometimes only) turn tool-less —
 * proven live at depth 2, where the child's grandchild saw zero extension
 * tools because its mount raced its first model call.
 *
 * A mount failure never takes the child down: the same capability-gap
 * discipline as root mounting — the child keeps running as a plain DSH agent
 * and the failure is reported loudly once.
