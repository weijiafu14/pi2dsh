The Pi tools allowlist/excludeTools become official scoped restrictions, customTools register in the child scope, delegation policy travels the official way, and the child\'s model resolves in three tiers — the explicit Pi model on the options, else the caller\'s LIVE route read from its durable session log\'s last request/header (so a mid-session /model switch in the DSH UI is inherited, proven live on the stock TUI), else the creation-time snapshot; a truly modelless child fails its first {{model}}-keyed prompt assembly. A per-child thinkingLevel becomes the child\'s own reasoningEffort through the official agent/request waterfall (never leaking to siblings or the parent). session.subscribe projects tool_execution_start/end from the durable log (tool-use accounting works), The child is served its EXTENSION SET exactly as real Pi loads one: the host\'s installed Pi packages, filtered by the creator\'s resource loader (its own getExtensions applies noExtensions/extensionsOverride — the creator\'s code decides; no loader means Pi\'s default, everything discovered), mounted as per-child package instances on the child agent\'s own ctx before createAgentSession returns — their tools register in the child scope, their handlers see the child session, and everything unwinds with the agent (leak-free by scope, not by bookkeeping). bindExtensions() reports per-extension mount failures to the binding\'s onError in Pi\'s {extensionPath, error} shape; one timing nuance: session_start reaches child-bound packages at creation rather than at the bindExtensions call. steer() and followUp() are async per Pi\'s AgentSession face (consumers chain .catch on the returned promise; steer interrupts, followUp queues behind the running turn), and abort() follows Pi\'s contract: the child turn is cancelled AND post-abort wakes (a late tool result reaching quiescence) are re-cancelled on every opening event until the next explicit prompt(). The child exposes session.sessionManager (readonly projection) whose getSessionFile() names a durable archive (`<id>.jsonl`) in genuine Pi session-file format — a Pi header line plus any Pi-only entries, parseable by Pi\'s own SessionManager; conversation content is NOT copied there, it projects live from the native DSH log. Handing a SessionManager opened FROM such an archive back to createAgentSession reopens the SAME persisted DSH session through the registry\'s official resume seam, across process restarts (pi-subagents\' tombstone resurrect shape). If a reopen fails, DSH\'s own persistence list() delivers the verdict (the check agent-loop itself uses): a POSITIVE "gone" retires the archive file so existsSync answers honestly from then on, while a composition merely lacking persistence keeps the token and fails loudly — absence of evidence never destroys a valid identity.
