# A Pi plugin's own chrome, drawn in DSH's web seats

Pi extensions do not only call tools — they **draw**. A status line while a job
runs, a widget listing what was found, a title, a spinner and its label, a card
the package renders itself, a line written straight into your composer, an
`@`-mention menu of its own entries. In Pi those land in a terminal UI. On DSH
they land in the **web shell's own slots**, through pi2dsh's browser half. The
Pi plugin is unmodified and knows nothing about any of it.

This matters more than it sounds: **33 of the 50 most-downloaded Pi plugins draw
something** (measured — see [Which plugins this is for](#which-plugins-this-is-for)).
Before this, all of that was invisible on DSH.

## Verified end to end: pi-powerline-footer

[`pi-powerline-footer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-powerline-footer) is a
real, unmodified npm plugin — a powerline-style status line showing the model,
thinking level, project and context usage. It is what this example installs,
and what the automated regression drives.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-work-x
dsh plugin --profile web add pi-powerline-footer
```

That is the whole install — the dsh-work-x suite carries the pi2dsh engine
AND the web presentation (the engine alone deliberately projects nothing
into the browser), and the engine mounts every Pi package in the profile.
Restart dsh afterwards: packages mount at startup.

If an add stops with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` (pnpm blocks dependency build
scripts by default): run `pnpm approve-builds` inside `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web`
— or set the listed packages to `true` under `allowBuilds` in that profile's
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` — then re-run the add.

Open the web app, start a session, and run the plugin's own command:

1. type `/powerline` in the composer;
2. **pick it from the suggestion popover** — it shares a prefix with
   `/powerline-perf`, so until one is picked the send button stays disabled;
3. send.

The status line appears as a floating status pill in the lower-right
(widget content taller than one line opens as a floating card there instead,
collapsible to a labelled pill):

```text
 DeepSeek-V4-Flash | think:off | pi2dsh | 0/1.0M (0.0%)
```

Colour included: the plugin emits terminal colour codes, and the browser half
paints them rather than printing them.

The exact segments depend on the package's layout and available width. Its
default layout can move context usage into a secondary terminal footer; the
Web bridge does not promise the complete Pi terminal footer. The regression
pins the original package to `0.20.2` and uses its supported layout setting
`left: ["model", "thinking", "context_pct"]` (empty right/secondary rows), so
all asserted segments fit the bridge's 80-column widget rendering. It checks
initial display, actual removal, re-enabling, and ANSI rendering—not full
terminal-editor or token-accounting parity.

## Which plugins this is for

Measured by reading the source of the 50 most-downloaded Pi packages —
`node scripts/survey-surface-usage.mjs`, recorded in
[`community/surface-usage.json`](../../community/surface-usage.json).

| Surface | Plugins in the top 50 | Some of them |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `setStatus` / `setWidget` | 28 | `pi-mcp-adapter`, `@juicesharp/rpiv-todo`, `pi-btw`, `@narumitw/pi-plan-mode`, `pi-fabric` |
| `setTitle` / `setHeader` / `setFooter` | 6 | `pi-powerline-footer`, `@narumitw/pi-statusline`, `pi-zentui` |
| working message / indicator / hidden-thinking label | 4 | `mitsupi`, `pi-cc-extensions`, `pi-zentui` |
| `registerMessageRenderer` / `registerEntryRenderer` / `appendEntry` | 14 | `pi-btw`, `pi-lens`, `@tintinweb/pi-subagents`, `@ff-labs/pi-fff` |
| `setEditorText` / `pasteToEditor` / `getEditorText` | 10 | `@juicesharp/rpiv-voice`, `pi-ask-user`, `@narumitw/pi-plan-mode` |
| `addAutocompleteProvider` | 2 | `@ff-labs/pi-fff`, `pi-cc-extensions` |

**What this table is and is not.** It counts **call sites in package source** —
which plugins would use these seats. It is not a claim that each plugin works:
that only comes from running one. Exactly one plugin here is verified end to
end (`pi-powerline-footer`, by the regression below); the rest are "the bridge
covers the surface they call", which is a weaker statement and is the reason
this paragraph exists.

## Where each call lands

Pi components render **text** — their contract is `render(width) => string[]` —
so the honest projection into a browser is that text, in the DSH slot that means
the same thing:

```text
Pi call                        pi2dsh (server half)         DSH web seat
ui.setStatus / setTitle    ->  per-session surface store ->  shell.overlay
ui.setHeader               ->                            ->  session.header.utilities
ui.setWidget               ->                            ->  floating pill/card (overlay)
ui.setFooter / working*    ->                            ->  conversation.composer.dock
appendEntry / sendMessage  ->  sidecar + custom types    ->  conversation.chat.turnTail
ui.setEditorText / paste   ->  draft request             ->  inputActions.setDraft
ui.addAutocompleteProvider ->  provider chain            ->  ctx.inputTriggers ('@')
```

The browser half is a normal DSH client plugin (`dsh.client`) reading its own
route (`/pi2dsh/…`); it does not touch DSH's internal RPC contracts. Every
surface above has its own contract test in
[`tests/presentation-surfaces.spec.ts`](../../tests/presentation-surfaces.spec.ts)
— a real Pi extension calling the real Pi method, read back through the real
route.

## Reproduce the check

```bash
ONLY=presentation-surfaces node scripts/verify-examples-e2e.mjs
```

A fresh temporary DSH home, the engine and `pi-powerline-footer` installed from
npm, the real web app driven in a browser, and an assertion that the dock holds
the plugin's own status line **and no raw escape codes**.

## If nothing appears

- **The command is not in the popover.** The package did not mount. `dsh plugin
  --profile web list` should show it; mounting happens at startup, so restart
  after adding.
- **The send button stays disabled.** A slash command whose prefix matches more
  than one command has to be picked from the popover first.
- **Nothing at all, no console error.** The browser half did not load. Check
  that the profile's `pi2dsh` has `dist/client.js`; a partial install is the
  usual cause — re-run the add and restart dsh.
