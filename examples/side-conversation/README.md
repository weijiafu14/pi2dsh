# Side conversations that leave the main thread alone

Ask something off-topic mid-session — "wait, who wrote Dune?" — without
derailing the conversation you are in. The Pi plugin **pi-btw** turns
`/btw <question>` into a separate thread; on DSH that thread is a real child
session, so it appears in DSH's own subagent list, opens in its own view with
its own composer, and **the main conversation gains nothing but a status
line**. Works in the DSH CLI and the DSH web app.

In the web app the answer also comes back where you asked it: a **floating
panel** over the conversation, showing that side thread and nothing else. Pi
packages present a side conversation as an overlay, and DSH's browser shell has
a seat for exactly that (`shell.overlay`), so pi2dsh ships its own browser half
to draw it — the Pi plugin is unmodified and knows nothing about it.

Everything below is copy-paste runnable and was verified end to end on a real
DSH loop — CLI and web. The screenshots in
[`../../docs/posting-kit/assets/`](../../docs/posting-kit/assets/) come from
this exact flow.

## 1. Install dsh-work-x

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-work-x@next
```

One install: the suite carries the pi2dsh engine, pi-btw, and the web
presentation — including its own side-chat window (a real chat card, not a
text projection). The engine alone deliberately projects nothing into the
browser, so on the web surface the suite IS the install line.

CLI-only usage still works with just the engine (`dsh plugin --profile
headless add pi2dsh pi-btw`): `/btw` runs the side thread and the answer
stays out of the main session either way.

If an add stops with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` (pnpm blocks dependency build
scripts by default): run `pnpm approve-builds` inside
`$DSH_HOME/profiles/web` — or set the listed packages to `true`
under `allowBuilds` in that profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — then re-run the
add command. Restart dsh afterwards: packages mount at startup.

## 2. Ask a side question

Start a session and ask something normal:

```sh
dsh --profile web
```

On a DSH home you have never opened, pick a workspace first — the button is
in the top bar. Until one exists the composer takes keystrokes and stays
empty, with nothing on screen saying why. (Found by the example regression
run, which starts from a genuinely fresh home every time.)

```text
Name three classic sorting algorithms, one line each.
```

Then take a detour:

```text
/btw who wrote the novel Dune? name only
```

The answer (`Frank Herbert.`) comes back in a thread of its own. Your main
conversation still holds only the sorting-algorithm exchange plus one
`btw · Completed` line.

In the web app (`dsh web`), the same two messages give you:

| Screenshot | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `01-side-conversation-main-thread-clean.png` | The main thread after the side question: sorting algorithms, `btw · Completed`, and a `1 subagent` control in the header. No trace of Dune. |
| `02-side-conversation-host-catalog.png` | DSH's own subagent list, with a `pi-btw side conversation` row (`continuable · not running`) |
| `03-side-conversation-injected-on-request.png` | After `/btw-inject`: the thread enters the main conversation as a context injection, and only then |
| `04-side-conversation-child-view.png` | The side thread opened: its own breadcrumb, its own composer, `Frank Herbert.` inside it |

Type `/btw` at the start of the composer to see the whole family in the
command palette — `/btw-new`, `/btw-tangent`, `/btw-summarize`,
`/btw-inject`, `/btw-model`, `/btw-clear`.

## 3. Bring an answer back, when you want it

Nothing is merged into the main conversation automatically — that stays your
explicit action, through the plugin's own commands:

```text
/btw-inject
```

injects the side thread into the main conversation as a context injection —
the main model then sees it and can act on it (`btw-inject · Injected BTW
thread (3 exchanges).`).

```text
/btw --save what year was Dune first published? year only
```

asks in the side thread and records the answer as the plugin's own note
(`btw · Saved BTW note to the session.`) — the answer itself still stays out
of the main conversation.

## 4. Reproduce the screenshots

With a DSH web instance running and this profile loaded:

```sh
PLAYWRIGHT_FROM=<a-project-that-has-playwright> \
  node docs/posting-kit/capture-screenshots.mjs out-dir --url http://127.0.0.1:<port>
```

The script drives the same two messages and **asserts** the property the
pictures are meant to show: it fails if the side answer ever appears in the
main conversation. Add `--locale zh-CN` for the Chinese UI.

## What this exercises in pi2dsh

- `createAgentSession` bridged onto a real DSH child agent (`ctx.agents`),
  with the parent's lineage and delegation depth carried across
- Pi's public, settable `AgentState.messages`: pi-btw seeds the side thread by
  assigning a transcript, which the bridge carries into the child's next
  prompt as a `<prior-conversation>` context injection
- the host's own child identity event (`subagent/descriptor`) appended inside
  the child's log — what makes DSH list the thread, name it after the package
  that started it, and reopen it as continuable
- Pi commands with arguments in the DSH web palette (every bridged command
  declares an input descriptor, so `/btw <question>` is parsed as a command
  and not sent as chat)
- Pi's numbered-collision naming translated to DSH's (`/btw:summarize` →
  `/btw-summarize`)
