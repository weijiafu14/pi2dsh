// Regression for the shipped examples, on the real dsh CLI.
//
// Every example under `examples/` claims a capability to the reader. This
// script re-runs the ones that can run headlessly, using the exact packages
// and commands their READMEs tell a user to install — so a behaviour change
// that breaks an example fails here rather than in someone's terminal.
//
//   gateway-compat   the example's own Pi provider against a REAL upstream,
//                    through the example's recording proxy — which forwards
//                    every request and streams the real response back. The
//                    proxy is not a stand-in endpoint; it only writes down
//                    what was sent, which is the only way to check that a
//                    compat declaration reached the wire. Nothing is mocked.
//   alibaba-token-plan  the published engine plus the unmodified Alibaba Pi
//                    provider against a real Plan subscription: cold-start
//                    dynamic model, tool loop, restart and secret scan.
//   vision-bridge    the real @kassing/pi-vision from npm against a live
//                    model and the example's own test image (needs
//                    DEEPSEEK_API_KEY and network).
//   side-conversation  boots the web profile with the real pi-btw and drives
//                    the browser the way the README does; the capture script
//                    asserts the property the example claims — the side
//                    answer never lands in the main conversation.
//   vision-bridge-web  the same vision example again, but through `dsh web` in a
//                    real browser: headless proves the bridge, this proves the
//                    surface, and the bar for done is both.
//   codex-image-gen  a real ChatGPT/Codex OAuth account drives the published
//                    image plugin through generation and reference-image edit;
//                    needs CODEX_AUTH_FILE because the account is the fixture.
//   tui-mcp          installs the real dsh-TUI + pi-mcp-adapter combination,
//                    then verifies the complete host-influenced matrix: TUI,
//                    lifecycle, three transports, discovery, direct/proxy/
//                    scripted calls, resources/prompts/images, approval,
//                    MCP Apps, elicitation, sampling, cancellation and restart.
//
// Usage: node scripts/verify-examples-e2e.mjs [outfile]
//        DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=… to include the live half; without it that half
//        is SKIPPED and reported as skipped, never as passed.
//
// The credential is read from the environment only and asserted absent from
// every captured artifact before anything is written.

 * per path: the tool path needs a non-error tool result; the companion path
 * needs the injected analysis AND proof the model could not have read the
