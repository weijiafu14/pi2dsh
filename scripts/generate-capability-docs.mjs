const PROSE = {
  tools: `Pi packages contribute tools and observe every tool call. Both map
onto DSH's own tool registry and its durable tool events, so a migrated tool
is indistinguishable from a native one at the call site: the model sees it in
the same catalog, the loop runs it through the same permission pipeline, and
results land in the session log in DSH's own shapes. A tool implementation can
still call Node APIs directly, just like any trusted DSH plugin; only work
handed to DSH's filesystem/subprocess/sandbox services inherits those providers.`,
  commands: `Slash commands, flags and editor-side input. Commands register
into DSH's command registry, so they appear in the CLI and in the web
command palette. Every bridged command declares an input descriptor, which is
what lets \`/name <arguments>\` parse as a command in the web app instead of
being sent as chat. Pi's never-throw collision behaviour is preserved.`,
  conversation: `The turn itself: injecting messages, transforming what enters
a step, and observing the loop. These map onto DSH's waterfalls and durable
events. Nothing here fabricates a result — where DSH has no equivalent moment,
the surface is registered and stated as never firing rather than faked.`,
  sessions: `Session lifecycle: naming, branching, switching, compaction and
child sessions. These run on DSH's own session services
(\`ctx.sessions.create/fork\`, \`ctx.compaction.compactNow\`, Cordis reload),
so a Pi package's branch really is a DSH session with lineage — visible in the
session list, resumable, and compactable by the host.

A package that opens a side conversation gets DSH's native subagent UI: the
bridge creates a real child agent/session through \`ctx.agents\`; the child is
listed, named after the package, opened in its own view and continuable. This
does not exercise the separate \`ctx.subagents\` provider seam. See
[\`examples/side-conversation\`](../../examples/side-conversation/).`,
  models: `Model directory, provider registration, credentials and per-request
overrides. There is exactly ONE model directory — DSH's llm configuration — and
Pi's registry is its projection, so a package never reaches a model except
through a route in that directory.

Which code carries the bytes depends on the provider. A package that only
declares a catalog gets no transport from the bridge: its models are served by
the host's own adapters and DSH credentials. A package that brings its own
transport (pi-ai's \`createProvider\`) becomes a real DSH route through
\`llm.registerAdapter\`, and from then on **that package's HTTP client carries
the turn, with its key resolved by Pi's credential chain and persisted in the
bridge's \`auth.json\`** rather than by DSH credentials. Worth knowing if you
audit where your keys go. Interactive OAuth flows from the Pi ecosystem run on
DSH-native interaction and persist with Pi's \`auth.json\` semantics.`,
  interaction: `Asking the user something, and drawing. Questions
(\`select\` / \`confirm\` / \`input\`) become real DSH user questions that
genuinely block the turn. pi2dsh also ships a DSH client module that redraws
portable presentation intent — status, widgets, headers, footers, editor text
and side conversations — in native Web slots. A Pi terminal component itself
is not mounted in the browser; terminal-only factories and raw key handling
remain headless or become an explicit Web-native projection.`,
  environment: `Project trust and dynamic resource discovery — the two places
where the host, not the package, owns the decision. Skills declared by a Pi
package are loaded through DSH's own skill filesystem. MCP server definitions
in Pi config are translated into official \`dsh-mcp-client\` entries by
\`pi2dsh mcp-config\`. A deliberately installed Pi MCP capability package is a
different case: its own transport, cache, OAuth and resource/prompt behavior
continues to run, while pi2dsh maps only its public host surfaces into DSH.`,

of a pure function is a second behaviour to keep in sync. The rest are the ones

overlay is honest about not drawing it.`,

# Pi capabilities on DSH, area by area

Every upstream-shaped rule the bridge currently tracks, what it maps onto in
DeepSeek Harness, and where the mapping differs. Nested objects such as
\`sessionManager\` may expose several methods behind one row; this is a runtime
rule catalog, not yet a callable-by-callable proof. These tables are generated
from the rules the bridge itself consults at runtime (\`src/compatibility.ts\`,
also reported by \`pi2dsh matrix --json\`), so they cannot drift from the
implementation.

**${upstreamSurfaces.length} upstream-shaped Pi rule rows total** — ${
  Object.entries(LEVEL_LABEL).filter(([level]) => totals[level] !== undefined)
    .map(([level, label]) => `${totals[level]} ${label.toLowerCase()}`).join(' · ')
} — plus **${importSymbols} imported symbols** from the three Pi runtime
packages (\`pi-coding-agent\`, \`pi-tui\`, \`pi-ai\`), which the bridge serves
from vendored or headless shims so a package's own Pi pins never load — listed
in [Imported Pi runtime symbols](imports.md).

The rule set additionally documents **${bridgeExtensions.length} bridge-only
compatibility extension** (\`${bridgeExtensions.map(entry => entry.name).join('`, `')}\`),
which is deliberately outside the upstream Pi ABI total.

Each area page carries two things per surface: what it does on DSH, and **how
it is built** — the DSH seam, service or waterfall behind it.

| Area | Surfaces | Status |
|---|---|---|
${written.filter(({ area }) => area !== undefined).map(({ area, upstreamRows, counts }) =>
  `| [${area.title}](${area.file}.md) | ${upstreamRows.length} | ${
    Object.entries(LEVEL_LABEL).filter(([level]) => counts[level] !== undefined)
      .map(([level, label]) => `${counts[level]} ${label.toLowerCase()}`).join(' · ')} |`).join('\n')}

## What the statuses mean

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Same semantics** | The DSH behaviour matches Pi's, including edge cases |
| **Mapped, difference stated** | The capability works; the row says exactly where the behaviour differs from Pi (representation, timing, or scope). Most surfaces sit here because the bridge documents differences rather than glossing over them |
| **Not available** | No safe mapping. The surface is accepted so packages keep running, and the gap is reported once through the capability ledger rather than throwing mid-turn |
| **Fails loud** | Calling it raises a structured, catchable error instead of returning a fabricated result |

A package that hits a "not available" surface during startup is marked
unusable with a removal hint, instead of half-working silently.
