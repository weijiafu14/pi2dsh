// would — one composer line naming an image on disk — and asserts the property
// the example claims, that a text-only chat model answers a question about the
// picture because the Pi package delegated it to a vision route.
//
// Why this exists separately from the headless check: a headless run proves the
// bridge, not the surface. `dsh web` has its own path into a turn, and a
// capability that works in the CLI and breaks in the browser has happened here
// before — which is why the completion bar is both surfaces, not either.
